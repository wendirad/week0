### Financial News and Stock Price Analysis

#### Project Overview
This project focuses on exploring the relationship between financial news sentiment and stock market behavior. By applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and quantitative analysis, the objective is to improve predictive analytics for market trends.

#### Approach

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Utilize Python libraries like pandas and numpy to import and preprocess data.
   - Ensure uniform time formats and address any textual inconsistencies.

2. **Descriptive Analysis**
   - Analyze textual properties such as headline lengths.
     - Metrics include mean, median, minimum, and maximum lengths.
   - Count articles by publisher to identify key contributors.
   - Study publication dates for trends, such as:
     - Frequency surges during major financial events or specific days.

3. **Text and Sentiment Analysis**
   - Conduct sentiment analysis on headlines to classify:
     - Positive, Neutral, or Negative sentiment.
   - Leverage NLP to extract:
     - Keywords or important phrases (e.g., "FDA approval," "price target").
     - Key topics using methods like LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) or TF-IDF.

4. **Time Series Insights**
   - Examine publication frequency over time:
     - Correlate peaks with significant market events.
   - Analyze publishing patterns by time:
     - Example: News predominantly released during pre-market hours (8â€“9 AM).

5. **Publisher Trends**
   - Identify top publishers and their contributions.
   - Investigate the types of content they focus on:
     - Financial reports, market insights, or corporate earnings.
   - For email-based publishers, analyze domains to categorize organizational contributors.
6. **Stock Price Analysis**
Loading historical stock price data and calculating key indicators, such as daily returns and technical analysis indicators (Moving Averages, RSI).
7. **Correlation Analysis**
Investigating the statistical relationship between sentiment scores from the news headlines and stock price movements using Pearson correlation.
8. **Visualizations**
Creating plots to visually explore trends, sentiment distributions, stock price movements, and the correlation between sentiment and stock performance.
